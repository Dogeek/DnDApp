# What is it?

DnD stands for dungeons & dragons a well-known tabletop roleplaying game, where the goal is to play as a character to venture into unknown lands, a magic-filled world, slain powerful monsters and level up your character. Sounds a lot like Skyrim, without any limitation, no scripted NPCs, no annoying unkillable children. Because you imagine everything that happens, and you can do anything. If you want to kill a beggar just for the kicks of it, then be it, if you don't want to save the world through the quest line that your DM carefully brewed, you can do it.
